# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## ü§î General Questions

### What is MiniGPT?

MiniGPT is an educational series that teaches you how to build a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) from scratch. It's designed for software engineers who want to understand how Large Language Models work without needing a PhD in machine learning.

### Who is this for?

- Software engineers curious about AI/ML
- Developers who want to understand LLMs
- Anyone who learns best by building
- Students looking for hands-on ML experience

### Do I need machine learning experience?

No! This series assumes you know Python but doesn't require any machine learning background. We explain everything from the ground up.

### How long does it take to complete?

Each part takes about 2-3 hours to complete, so the full series takes about 10-15 hours. You can go at your own pace and skip around if needed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Questions

### What Python version do I need?

Python 3.8 or higher. We recommend Python 3.9+ for the best experience.

### Do I need a GPU?

Not required! The examples are designed to work on CPU, though a GPU will make training faster. Google Colab provides free GPU access.

### What's the difference between this and other ML courses?

| Traditional ML Courses | MiniGPT Series |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Heavy on theory, light on code | **Code-first approach** |
| Assumes ML background | **No ML experience needed** |
| Abstract mathematical concepts | **Concrete Python implementations** |
| Large, complex datasets | **Simple, understandable examples** |
| Black box explanations | **Transparent, step-by-step building** |

### Can I use this in production?

This is primarily for educational purposes. The implementations prioritize clarity over performance. For production use, consider using established libraries like Transformers or GPT models from OpenAI.

## üìö Learning Questions

### What will I learn?

By the end of the series, you'll understand:
- How text becomes numbers (tokenization)
- How numbers become meaningful vectors (embeddings)
- How the model pays attention (attention mechanisms)
- How everything fits together (model architecture)
- How to train and generate text (training & generation)

### Do I need to follow the parts in order?

It's recommended to follow the parts in order since each builds on the previous one. However, you can skip around if you're already familiar with certain concepts.

### What if I get stuck?

### Can I contribute?

Absolutely! We welcome contributions. See our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## üîß Setup Questions

### How do I get started?

1. **Option 1 (Recommended)**: Open notebooks in Google Colab
2. **Option 2**: Clone the repo and run locally
3. **Option 3**: Install via pip (when available)

### What if I get import errors?

Make sure you've installed the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

### Can I run this on Windows/Mac/Linux?

Yes! The code is cross-platform and works on all major operating systems.

## üéØ Project Questions

### Is this open source?

Yes! This project is open source under the MIT License. You can use, modify, and distribute it freely.

### How can I stay updated?

- ‚≠ê Star the repository
- üëÄ Watch for releases
- üìß Subscribe to updates (coming soon)

### Can I use this for my own projects?

Yes! The MIT License allows you to use this code in your own projects. Just make sure to include the license notice.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### The notebook won't run in Colab

Make sure you're using the latest version of the notebook. If you're still having issues, try:
1. Restart the runtime
2. Clear all outputs
3. Run cells from top to bottom

### I'm getting CUDA errors

If you're using a GPU and getting CUDA errors:
1. Make sure your PyTorch installation supports CUDA
2. Check that your GPU has enough memory
3. Try reducing batch size or model size

### The model is too slow

For faster training:
1. Use a GPU if available
2. Reduce model size (fewer layers/heads)
3. Use smaller batch sizes
4. Consider using mixed precision training

### I don't understand a concept

- Read the explanations in the notebooks carefully
- Try the code examples step by step
- Look up additional resources if needed
- Ask questions in our community
